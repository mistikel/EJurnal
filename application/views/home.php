                                Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology published since 2005 (E-ISSN 1817-3195 / ISSN 1992-8645) is an International refereed research publishing journal with a focused aim on promoting and publishing original high quality research dealing with theoretical and scientific aspects in all disciplines of Information Technology. JATIT is an international scientific research journal focusing on issues in information technology research. A large number of manuscript inflows, reflects its popularity and the trust of world's research community. JATIT is indexed with major indexing and abstracting organizations and is published in both electronic and print format.



                                 All technical or research papers and research results submitted to JATIT should be original in nature, never previously published in any journal or undergoing such process across the globe. All the submissions will be peer-reviewed by the panel of experts associated with JATIT. Submitted papers should meet the internationally accepted criteria and manuscripts should follow the style of the journal for the purpose of both reviewing and editing. Indexing information is found at the indexing and abstracting page of JATIT.

                                What do we look for in your Research while conducting blind Peer Review

                                1) Relevance
                                Its contents have to be of use to anyone practicing one of the disciplines addressed by the journal.
                                ◾The paper is relevant to the technical scope of the journal and to the professional interests and activities of its audience.
                                ◾Ideally it should present new knowledge or technology that has the potential to help the reader in their professional work as practicing scientists / engineers.

                                2) Innovation
                                It should present new knowledge or technology, or analyze previously known facts in a new way.
                                ◾A paper should present new knowledge or analyze previously known facts in a new way. Additionally it should take full account of previously published work on its subject.
                                ◾A case history is appropriate if it presents the application of existing technology in a new way or in a new location or environment where it has not previously been used and that requires new and previously un-used techniques or analyses.
                                ◾A review paper is appropriate if it finds connections between previously unrelated facts or commonality between previously uncompelled facts and results, or makes deductions that give the reader substantiated guidance on the accuracy and applicability of the reviewed analyses.

                                3) Technical Detail
                                It should be logically sound, and it should give sufficient detail to allow the reader to replicate the work it describes and to assess its applicability to other environments.
                                ◾The research design, methods, and analyses are adequately defined and clearly described, well integrated, well reasoned, and appropriate to the aims of the project.
                                ◾The paper should present sufficient detail of the application, methods and analyses employed and results achieved to allow the reader to replicate the work descried but also to evaluate its applicability to the environment and problems on which they are working.
                                ◾Statistical / Analytical tests are appropriate and the assumptions underlying the use of statistics are fulfilled by the data.
                                ◾The statistics are reported correctly and appropriately.

                                4) Presentation and Documentation
                                It should present clearly and concisely in the JATIT's standard format all relevant data and information to support the conclusions and to indicate their limitations.
                                ◾The text is well written and easy to follow.
                                ◾The introduction builds a logical case and context for the problem statement.
                                ◾The problem statement is clear and well articulated.
                                ◾The data reported are accurate (e.g., the numbers add up) and appropriate; tables, graphs and figures are used effectively and agree with the text.
                                ◾The amount of data presented is sufficient and appropriate.
                                ◾Results are presented effectively; the interpretations of the results are appropriate and the conclusions accurate.
                                ◾The conclusions are clearly stated and follow from the design, methods, and results; the justification of conclusions is well articulated.
                                ◾The study limitations are discussed.
                                ◾Statistical differences are distinguished from meaningful differences.
                                ◾Practical significance or theoretical implications are discussed.
                                ◾Reference citations are complete, accurate and up-to-date. The number of references is appropriate and their selection is judicious.

                                5) Professional Conduct (Responsibilty of Authors)
                                It must avoid commercialism and plagiarism, and must not have been published previously.
                                ◾There are no commercial references.
                                ◾There are no instances of plagiarism.
                                ◾Ideas and materials of others are correctly attributed.
                                ◾Substantial portions of the data or study should not have been previously published.

                                All peer review is now based on the above criterion for all submitted manuscripts
